Technical decision:

+ How did you implement styling? What are the pros and cons? Why did you chose this approach? 
  - I selected CSS Modules way (SASS) for this project.
  + Pros : 
  - All class names and animation names are scoped locally- by default, each component will have its own Css files.
  - When scaling projects, we have less overrides and trouble.
  - By having a common css files where we can define variables, mixin or function which is using for other components, we can share it everywhere and must easier to know whatâ€™s used or not vv.
  + Cons :
  - Because each component has its own Css files so we will have many files Css
   Because some of pros above, I decide to choose this way.

+ How did you share state between components? What are the pros and cons? Why did you chose this approach?
   - Redux helps me to share state between components
   + Pros :
   - Easy to start writing (if you can get over the syntax)
   - Less re-rendering!
   - Total separation of data and presentation
   + Cons :
   - Community conventions are still developing so It hards to have a standard structure
   - Syntax is complex for someone
   For me, I tried others way as using context-api but Redux is covenient and I think It has much better than other way so I choose this

+ Did you use React hooks? Why or why not?
   + Yes, Because : 
   - We can maintains internal state data with simplified and less code.
   - Make the code look cleaner, easier to read
   - Create re-usable, isolated components to avoid redundant logic.

+ How did you prevent wasted renders?
   + I tried to use something like:
   - React memo
   - UseCallBack
   to prevent wasted renders
